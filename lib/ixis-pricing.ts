 * Canonical Lyrixis prices (Awad, 2026-10-06). 100 Ixis = $1.
 *
 * What is charged today: Wallet SKU `lyrixis.track.unlock` = 300 Ixis ($3) per song.
 * The 1–99 row in `pricing_tiers` must show the same number. Prod was fixed to 300 by
 * migration 20261005_track_unlock_price_300.sql; the display code still pins the 1-song
 * tier to the SKU price so an old seed can never show 299.
 *
 * All-Access is $30/month (3,000 Ixis). Card checkout is not built, and this file does not
 * start a charge. Label / Enterprise has no fixed price.
